2.Design suitable data structures and implement Pass-I and Pass-II of a two-pass macro- processor. The output of Pass-I (MNT, MDT and intermediate code file without any macro definitions) should be input for Pass-II.
Write a program to recognize infix expression using LEX and YAAC.
1 .Design suitable Data structures and implement Pass-I and Pass-II of a two-pass assembler for pseudo-machine. Implementation should consist of a few instructions from each category and few assembler directives. The output of Pass-I (intermediate code file and symbol table) should be input for Pass-II.
